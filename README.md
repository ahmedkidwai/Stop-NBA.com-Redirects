# Stop-NBA.com-Redirects

The NBA does not control its website in Canada, outsourcing its rights to a third party that focuses primarily on the Toronto Raptors and forces users to dig through the site to find boxscore and highlights. Canadians are being re-routed to ca.nba.com when trying to access the US site (which does not have the problems I previously listed). To mediate this issue I have developed a quick chrome extension that will get users in Canada to NBA.com :).
